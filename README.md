## About Master The Mainframe Contest

The [Master the Mainframe](https://masterthemainframe.com/) is a fun way to get hands-on experience across a variety of technologies, to develop valuable skills, and to earn [digital badges](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/education/master-the-mainframe-badges) – with no prior knowledge required!

* **Part 1:**  Learn the basics of navigation, files, and programs.
* **Part 2:** Practice programming languages, operating systems, and technologies.
* **Part 3:** Participate in real-world challenges.

### How does it work?

The Master the [Mainframe Competition](https://masterthemainframe.com/) is comprised of three levels:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Level One" %}
**LEVEL ONE \| CONNECT**  
Jump into your mainframe experience right through the VS Code. You’ll get connected to the mainframe, run some commands, check out data sets, grab some system vitals, and see how mainframe virtualization delivers real-world power to apps of any size.

**PRIZES**  
**Feed 2 Children for a Day**: For every Level One finisher, a donation will be made to ShareTheMeal
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Level Two" %}
**LEVEL TWO \| DISCOVER**  
Rack up valuable skills as you craft Python programs, explore the Unix side of things, hack away at JCL, streamline work in Bash scripts, fire up, and connect it all together with Z Open Automation Utilities. You’ll be pushing the system to the limits, and proving your talent as you complete each challenge.

**PRIZES**

**All Finishers:  
Exclusive Special Event**: Gain access to exclusive online career development activity featuring access to employers and career opportunities.  
**Industry Recognized Digital Badge**: Earn the Level Two IBM Master the Mainframe badge certifying your skills.  
**$500 e-gift card**: Finishers entered into a drawing for a chance to win one of 45 $500 e-gift cards.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Level Three" %}
**LEVEL THREE \| REAL-WORLD CHALLENGE**

Hit the turbo and make it all count. Level 3 takes everything you learned before and brings it to the next level, bringing Linux into the mix, along with industry powerhouse languages Rexx and COBOL. You’ll take a deep dive into the capabilities of Zowe, and then take control of it all through Ansible. Once you’ve completed everything, the Final Challenge unlocks, which is where you’ll create a truly awesome mainframe masterpiece.

**PRIZES**

**All Finishers:**  
Limited edition 2020 IBM Master the Mainframe T-Shirt & an industry-recognized Level Three IBM Master the Mainframe badge.

**Top 2 Individuals from each Region:**  
$2500 travel stipend to visit an IBM event in your region and meet with key executives and employers. [Click here to see Regions](https://masterthemainframe.com/#faq)

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Why Should I Compete?

Besides the awesome prizes, you can obtain unprecedented exposure to a wide variety of enterprise systems, software, and products. You can also earn an Enterprise Computing Open Badge to put on your resume or social media pages, so potential employers can easily find you. Yup, that’s right – this is one competition that can even land you a job!

While you learn new enterprise computing skills and languages not often taught in school, you can also earn badges and can show your support to end world hunger. All you have to do is sign up for [\#MasterTheMainframe](http://ibm.biz/double-the-meal-registration), a free online coding challenge for beginners, and finish level one – just an hour of your time. IBM will take care of the rest by donating four meals to children in need. Students will also have access to win badges and prizes, earn scholarship money, learn new tech skills, gain access to jobs, and much more. Join us in helping to make the world a better place.
